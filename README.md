# FreshTomatoes
Fresh Tomatoes displays several of my favorite movies and plays a trailer for each when a user clicks the movie's picture.

## Installing and Running the Program
You will need Python to run this program. Within Python, there is a program called IDLE that will be used to run the files. Download the files and open `entertainment_center.py` with IDLE. This will be the only file that you actually need to open. Go to the 'Run' tab and click on 'Run Module'. This will start the program, which will build out the needed HTML and open a web-browser with the page ready to use.

## Built With:
Python and HTML
